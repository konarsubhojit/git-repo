# Project Restructure and Android App Implementation

## Summary

This document describes the changes made to restructure the Cloud Sync Application and add a native Android frontend.

## Changes Made

### 1. Folder Restructure

The project has been reorganized into two main directories:

```
.
├── backend/          # Node.js backend server
└── frontend/         # Android mobile app
```

**Backend folder** contains:
- All Node.js server code
- OAuth authentication implementations
- Cloud storage service integrations
- API routes and middleware
- Package dependencies

**Frontend folder** contains:
- Android application (CloudSyncApp)
- Google account selection functionality
- OneDrive authentication using MSAL
- Material Design UI

### 2. Backend Changes

- Moved all backend files from root to `backend/` folder
- Created dedicated `backend/README.md` with setup instructions
- All functionality remains the same, just relocated
- Server runs from `backend/` directory now

### 3. Frontend Android App

Created a complete Android application with the following features:

#### Main Features
- **Google Account Selection**: Users can select from already logged-in Google accounts on their device
- **OneDrive Account Management**: Users can sign in and manage OneDrive accounts using MSAL
- **Cloud Sync**: Integration ready for syncing data to Google Drive or OneDrive
- **Material Design**: Modern Android UI with Material Design 3 components

#### App Structure
```

│   │   │   ├── MainActivity.java              # Main screen
│   │   │   ├── AccountSelectionActivity.java  # Google account picker
│   │   │   ├── AccountAdapter.java            # RecyclerView adapter
│   │   │   └── OneDriveAuthActivity.java      # OneDrive auth
│   │   ├── res/
│   │   │   ├── layout/                        # UI layouts
│   │   │   ├── values/                        # Strings, colors, themes
│   │   │   └── raw/                           # MSAL config
│   │   └── AndroidManifest.xml
│   ├── build.gradle
│   └── proguard-rules.pro
├── gradle/
├── build.gradle
└── settings.gradle
```

#### Key Components

**MainActivity**
- Main entry point of the app
- Displays connected accounts status
- Provides access to account selection and OneDrive management
- Contains sync button (enabled when at least one account is connected)

**AccountSelectionActivity**
- Retrieves Google accounts from device using AccountManager
- Displays accounts in a RecyclerView
- Requests GET_ACCOUNTS permission if needed
- Returns selected account to MainActivity

**OneDriveAuthActivity**
- Implements Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL)
- Handles OneDrive sign-in and sign-out
- Manages authentication state
- Uses OAuth 2.0 flow with redirect URIs

**AccountAdapter**
- RecyclerView adapter for displaying account list
- Shows account name and type
- Handles click events for account selection

#### Dependencies
- AndroidX libraries (AppCompat, Material, ConstraintLayout, RecyclerView)
- Google Play Services Auth (for Google account access)
- Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL) (for OneDrive)
- Retrofit and OkHttp (for API calls - ready for future use)

#### Permissions
- `INTERNET` - For API calls and cloud services
- `GET_ACCOUNTS` - For accessing Google accounts on device
- `USE_CREDENTIALS` - For using account credentials

### 4. Documentation Updates

**Main README.md**
- Updated to reflect new folder structure
- Added quick start for both backend and frontend
- Documented features for both components

**Backend README.md**
- Dedicated backend documentation
- Setup and installation instructions
- API endpoints reference
- Configuration guide

**Frontend README.md**
- Comprehensive Android app documentation
- Detailed setup instructions for MSAL configuration
- Troubleshooting guide
- Security notes

**QUICKSTART.md**
- Updated with separate backend and frontend setup
- Step-by-step guide for both components
- Configuration instructions for OAuth providers
- Usage examples and troubleshooting

### 5. Configuration Files

**Android Project**
- `build.gradle` files for project and app module
- `gradle.properties` for build configuration
- `settings.gradle` for module configuration
- `auth_config_msal.json` for OneDrive authentication
- `.gitignore` for Android-specific excludes

**Android Resources**
- String resources for all UI text
- Color resources matching Material Design
- Theme definitions with custom styles
- Layout files for all activities
- Adaptive launcher icons configuration

## Technical Implementation Details

### Google Account Selection
Uses Android's AccountManager API to:
1. Request GET_ACCOUNTS permission at runtime
2. Query accounts by type "com.google"
3. Display accounts in a selectable list
4. Return selected account to calling activity

### OneDrive Authentication
Uses Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL) to:
1. Configure OAuth client with app-specific settings
2. Handle interactive sign-in with browser redirect
3. Manage single account mode
4. Store authentication tokens securely
5. Support sign-out functionality

### UI/UX Design
- Material Design 3 components
- Card-based layout for account sections
- Clear status indicators
- Disabled/enabled states for actions
- Proper color theming (primary blue for Google, OneDrive blue for Microsoft)

### Future Integration Points
- Sync button ready to implement actual sync logic
- Backend API client structure prepared with Retrofit
- Proper state management for account connections
- SharedPreferences for persisting selections

## Testing

### Backend Testing
- Backend server starts successfully from new location
- All existing functionality preserved
- Environment variables properly loaded
- API endpoints remain accessible

### Frontend Testing
Required for full testing:
- Android Studio build (not performed in this environment)
- Device/emulator deployment
- Permission grants at runtime
- OAuth provider configuration completion

## Migration Notes

For existing deployments:
1. Update any deployment scripts to reference `backend/` directory
2. Environment variables remain in `backend/.env`
3. Dependencies must be installed in `backend/` directory
4. Server start command runs from `backend/` directory

## Next Steps

To complete the implementation:
1. Configure OAuth credentials for both Google and Microsoft
2. Generate Android app signature hash for MSAL
3. Update MSAL configuration files with actual credentials
4. Build and test the Android app in Android Studio
5. Implement actual sync functionality between app and backend API
6. Generate proper launcher icons using Android Studio Asset Studio
7. Test end-to-end data sync flow

## Security Considerations

- OAuth client secrets must not be committed to repository
- Android signature hashes must match in all configuration files
- MSAL configuration requires proper redirect URI registration
- Production builds should use signed release keys
- HTTPS should be used for all backend communication in production

## Conclusion

The project has been successfully restructured into a monorepo containing both backend and frontend components. The Android app provides native mobile access to Google and OneDrive account management, with a foundation ready for implementing cloud sync functionality.
